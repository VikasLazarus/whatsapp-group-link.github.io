    <h2>Rules and Regulations for WhatsApp Groups</h2>
    <p>
        To ensure a healthy and positive environment, every <strong>WhatsApp group link</strong>
        we share comes with a set of unspoken rules. While each group admin may have specific guidelines, these are the universal rules you must follow to avoid being banned.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Respect Privacy:</strong>
            Never message a group member personally without their explicit permission. This is considered harassment and will get you reported.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>No Spamming:</strong>
            Do not flood the group with forwarded messages, promotional links, or fake news. Share content that is relevant to the group topic.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>No Hate Speech:</strong>
            Bullying, racism, religious discrimination, or abusive language is strictly prohibited.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Keep it Clean:</strong>
            Do not share adult content, violence, or illegal material. These groups are monitored, and violators are removed instantly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Respect Admins:</strong>
            The group admin has the final say. Do not change the group icon or name unless you are authorized to do so.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Is Joining WhatsApp Groups Safe?</h2>
    <p>Safety is our top priority. While we do our best to filter out malicious links, users must remain vigilant. WhatsApp is a public platform, and joining a group means sharing your phone number with other participants.</p>
    <h3>Safety Tips for Users:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Hide Profile Picture:</strong>
            Go to WhatsApp Settings &gt;Privacy &gt;Profile Photo and set it to "My Contacts" or "Nobody" if you are joining public groups.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Two-Step Verification:</strong>
            Enable two-step verification to protect your account from being hacked.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Ignore Unknown Links:</strong>
            If a group member sends a suspicious link claiming you won a prize, do not click it. It could be a phishing scam.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Block &amp;Report:</strong>
            If anyone harasses you, block them immediately and report them to WhatsApp.
